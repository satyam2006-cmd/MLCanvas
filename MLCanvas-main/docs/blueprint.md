# **App Name**: ML Canvas

## Core Features:

- CSV Upload & Preview: Allows users to upload CSV files and preview the data in a tabular format.
- Automated EDA: Performs automatic exploratory data analysis, including missing value detection, outlier detection, correlation heatmap, and distribution plots.
- Model Training: Train one or two ML models such as Linear Regression or Logistic Regression.
- Model Parameter Adjustment: Interactively control model parameters such as learning rate and epochs.
- Visualization of Model Performance: Show key information, such as decision boundaries, loss vs. epoch curves, and accuracy graphs.
- Prediction via Manual Input: Allow users to input data manually and view real-time prediction updates, comparing predictions across models.
- Prediction Explainer: Explain individual predictions. Uses a generative AI tool to incorporate model coefficients, SHAP values, and local explanations in its response, for improved intelligibility.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey a sense of intelligence, sophistication, and depth, drawing inspiration from the academic and analytical nature of machine learning.
- Background color: Very light desaturated indigo (#F0F8FF), providing a clean, subtle backdrop that ensures readability and reduces visual fatigue.
- Accent color: Vivid violet (#9400D3), placed approximately 30 degrees to the 'left' of indigo in HSL color space, to highlight interactive elements and important metrics with contrast and visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons to represent different ML concepts, ensuring clarity and visual consistency.
- Employ a clean, modular layout with clear visual hierarchy, making the interface intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Subtle animations when adjusting parameters or visualizing data to provide clear visual feedback and enhance user engagement.
